# Bonemeal-Packets for 1.16.3
 Bonemeal Packets is a mod made for the fabric modloader. This mods focuses on an annoying issue bonemeal storage! When you've used that composter enough you'll have    alot of bonemeal lying around so why not make it into a packet instead which is more space efficient. A bonemeal packet is basically just compressed bonemeal :)
